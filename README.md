# clash_royale_vis

Creation, cleaning and visualisation of Clash Royale card datausing Python and Tableau.

The Tableau dashboard was created to aid players in the data exploration of card stats within the game. 
I had one fundemental flaw with my Tableau Dashboard and that was the three tiles at the top did not change dynamically with change to the filters, they were instead static and displayed the same information at all times. I anyone knows a way to change this please let me know!
